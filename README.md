# Movie-Recommender-Map-Reduce

This project is done as an assignment to subject Big Data and Distributed Programming. Below are the conditions specified for this project.

This project is based on Map-Reduce Framework. This project is done using Python and Spark.
In this project a basic movie recommender system is implemented. A dataset is given which has multiple csv files. These csv files have data corresponding to movie ratings.

The input is: ​userId ​and a ​movieId ​the user liked. 
Based on the given ​movieId and ​userId ​we need to recommend top 5 movies for the given user (​userId​).

The idea is to build an algorithm that creatively recommend the most suited for the user.
